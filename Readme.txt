### Project Overview

The project is written in Python and utilizes the Pygame library. It represents a simple implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, featuring a player-controlled Pac-Man character, cookies to collect, power-ups for special abilities, and ghosts to avoid or consume during power-up states.

#### How to Play:

- Use arrow keys to navigate Pac-Man through the maze.
- Collect cookies to earn points.
- Avoid ghosts, unless you've collected a power-up.
- Power-ups grant special abilities, allowing Pac-Man to consume ghosts.
- The game has multiple phases, alternating between chasing and scattering behaviors for the ghosts.

#### Setup:

1. Install Python (if not installed).
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game: `python pacman_game.py`

#### Controls:

- Arrow Keys: Move Pac-Man
- Close the game window to exit.

#### Features:

- Classic Pac-Man gameplay with a simplified maze.
- Ghosts with alternating chase and scatter behaviors.
- Cookies and power-ups to collect.
- Special abilities for Pac-Man during power-up states.
- Score tracking and lives system.
